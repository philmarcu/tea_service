## Overview
üçµ Tea Service is a subscription app designed to let a customer subscribe to regular shipments of tea for a period of their choosing - monthly, quarterly or annually. A customer can suscribe, cancel a subscription, and view all of their previous subscriptions whether they are active, pending or cancelled. A customer can also view all teas currently stored in the database. Future feature may involve consuming Tea API for data.
